# Project 6 - *TranslateME*

Submitted by: **TRANG MAI HOANG**

**Translate ME** is a user-friendly mobile application designed to break down language barriers with ease and efficiency.

Key Features:
- Instant Translation: Users can input text and receive immediate translations in the selected target language.
- Language Selection: A wide array of languages to choose from, with easy-to-navigate source and target language pickers.
- Translation History: A comprehensive history of past translations is available, allowing users to revisit and learn from previous interactions.
- Intuitive Interface: A clean and straightforward UI ensures that users can navigate the app with minimal effort.
- Language Pairing: The innovative 'languagePair' feature allows users to quickly switch between language pairs, formatted as "source|target" for convenience.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total
